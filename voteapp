2) observed before me , master node has created the pods so I have to edit the yaml file with a different app names to avoid clash.

Instead created new namespace and pointed pods to this



[root@ip-172-31-21-239 k8s-specifications]# kubectl get ns
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   4d23h
kube-node-lease   Active   4d23h
kube-public       Active   4d23h
kube-system       Active   4d23h


*** Create new namespace

[root@ip-172-31-21-239 k8s-specifications]# kubectl create ns namespaceaslam


namespace/namespaceaslam created
[root@ip-172-31-21-239 k8s-specifications]# kubectl get ns
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   4d23h
kube-node-lease   Active   4d23h
kube-public       Active   4d23h
kube-system       Active   4d23h
namespaceaslam    Active   5s



**** pointing to this new namespace 

[root@ip-172-31-21-239 k8s-specifications]# kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=namespaceaslam
Context "kubernetes-admin@kubernetes" modified

[root@ip-172-31-21-239 k8s-specifications]# kubectl apply -f .
deployment.apps/db1 created
service/db1 created
deployment.apps/redis1 created
service/redis created
deployment.apps/result1 created
deployment.apps/vote1 created
deployment.apps/worker1 created
Error from server (Invalid): error when creating "result-service.yaml": Service "result1" is invalid: spec.ports[0].nodePort: Invalid value: 32000: provided port is already allocated
Error from server (Invalid): error when creating "vote-service.yaml": Service "vote1" is invalid: spec.ports[0].nodePort: Invalid value: 32001: provided port is already allocated


Now changed the Nodeport to 32005 and 32006 respectively

[root@ip-172-31-21-239 k8s-specifications]# vi result-service.yaml
[root@ip-172-31-21-239 k8s-specifications]# vi vote-service.yaml


But then getting error on worker 

[root@ip-172-31-21-239 k8s-specifications]# kubectl get po -n namespaceaslam

#### Please note i tried without creating new namespace. Edited the yaml files and then tried kubectl appl -f . (here all pods got created)
then deleted voting pod worker pod and db pod one-by-one. 

observations :

1) when voting pod deleted within seconds another pod came up there was no effect on vote app or result app
2) when Worker pod deleted it was showing current pod terminating and new pod container creating .. later new pod came up. No effect for vote and result here as well . it was working as expected
3) when db pod is deleted, another pod cameup like expected. vote application is working since it has no connection to db. but result though app is running there is no result shown as expected
4)later we see there was a restart to worker pod
